/**
 * The PFPaymentTransactionObserver listens to the payment queue, processes a payment by running business logic,
 * and completes the transaction. It's a complex interaction and best explained as follows:
 * 1) an observer object is created and added to the payment queue, typically before IAP happens (but not necessarily),
 * 2) PFPurchase creates a payment and adds it to the payment queue,
 * 3) when the observer sees this payment, it runs the business logic associated with this payment,
 * 4) when the business logic finishes, the observer completes the transaction. If the business logic does not finish, the transaction is not completed, which means the user does not get charged,
 * 5) after the transaction finishes, custom UI logic is run.
