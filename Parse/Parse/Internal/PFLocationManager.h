/**
 PFLocationManager is an internal class which wraps a CLLocationManager and
 returns an updated CLLocation via the provided block.

 When -addBlockForCurrentLocation is called, the CLLocationManager's
 -startUpdatingLocations is called, and upon CLLocationManagerDelegate callback
 (either success or failure), any handlers that were passed to this class will
 be called _once_ with the updated location, then removed. The CLLocationManager
 stopsUpdatingLocation upon a single failure or success case, so that the next
 location request is guaranteed a speedily returned CLLocation.
