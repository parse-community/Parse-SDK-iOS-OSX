 The `PFUser` class is a local representation of a user persisted to the Parse Data.
 This class is a subclass of a `PFObject`, and retains the same functionality of a `PFObject`,

 Many APIs responsible for linking a `PFUser` with Facebook or Twitter have been deprecated in favor of dedicated
 utilities for each social network. See `PFFacebookUtils`, `PFTwitterUtils` and `PFAnonymousUtils` for more information.
